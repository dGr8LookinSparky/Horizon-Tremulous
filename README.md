# Ambush - Tremulous - Remake/Rework of QVM/Mod
This is a small project of an old mod called Ambush (using teabot as a start point.) which aims to help me learn about tremulous' code.

## What is tremulous and what is that thing that you call QVM and Mod
Tremulous is a FPS (first person shooter) game originally made as a mod of the popular game Quake III.
It was originally made by a team called DarkLegion. (If I am wrong, I will happily correct these statements.)
How is Tremulous any different? Well, for the simple answer: It simplified having servers, it has a building system which is great and it has quite a few other features also appealing.
Now, what is a QVM and a Mod. First of, there is a major difference between both.
A QVM is a compiled source code (most likely taken from the game) that alters the game and that is server-sided (Which means that the server can make your rifle shoot 1337 bullets per shot or also make you run 10 times faster without you having to download a single file from the server (Apart from the map you are on, of course. But these are seperate from the QVM and will not be explained here.))
A Mod is a compressed zip file with its extension renamed to `.pk3`. Why .pk3? That is a good question that sadly I have no answer for (Or at least for now.) The major difference between a QVM and a Mod is that a Mod contains a qvm and other more major changing objects like models, sounds and so on.
Now why would we not call a QVM a Mod? Well, you can actually call it a Mod. It doesn't really matter that much.
But when you tell someone you have a QVM, they should in general think that this Mod has no major altering features (Like models and such once again. Yes a rifle that shoots 1337 bullets is a major change, but not as much as a new sound or a new model completely which both comes with their own new rules.)
But yes. You could call a QVM a mod. But personally I have been calling them, QVM and Mod with a clear distinction between them. A lot of other developers might tell you otherwise, but to be fair, it is more a personal preference than a convention. There is not really a convention on Tremulous.
Hopefully this helped you understand a little more what tremulous is. If not, grangerhub is the best place to ask about it. I, myself, am part of this awesome community and cannot wait to meet you there as well as in-game.

## How to help
The simplest way to help is to join this awesome community: https://grangerhub.com (Quick link to the forums: https://forum.grangerhub.com)
Another way to help could be to help implementing features into the QVM. (Note that the QVM will be ported to the version `1.3` once it is fully released.)
You could also help finding bugs and/or create issues of those said bugs/glitches or unintended and/or unbalanced problems that needs fixing.
One last way you could help is by sharing this repository or the website/forum written above.

## My changes
* I am currently cleaning up the mess a little bit and putting the variables, defines and so on in the same place for easier work.
* I am also working on figuring out where everything is and they can be seen in the README-Avarthar.txt file as they will be added.

## 10 latest updates
1. Initial Commit
2. Fixed a few problems when creating the github repository.
3. Created a seperate branch for testing and made sure the QVM compiled accordingly.

## When to expect an update
I would suggest not to wait too much on updates. I will be updating this project as often as I possibly can, but I cannot make promises that I am not sure to be able to fullfil.
