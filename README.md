# Ambush - Tremulous - Remake/Rework of QVM/Mod
This is a small project of an old mod called Ambush (using teabot as a start point.) which aims to help me learn about tremulous' code.

## My changes
* I am currently cleaning up the mess a little bit and putting the variables, defines and so on in the same place for easier work.
* I am also working on figuring out where everything is and they can be seen in the README-Avarthar.txt file as they will be added.
